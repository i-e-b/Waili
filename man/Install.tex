\section{Installation}

\subsection{Requirements}

Before you start building the library, make sure you have the following items
at hand:
\begin{itemize}
\item a decent UNIX system,
\item \emph{GNU Make},
\item a \CC\ compiler that adheres to the \emph{ISO \CC\ Standard}, e.g.\
    e.g.\ \emph{GNU \CC\ 2.7.2},
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Building the package}

\begin{itemize}
\item Extract the archive.
\item Change the current directory to \texttt{Lifting}.
\item Enter
    \begin{quote}
    \texttt{make}
    \end{quote}
    to build the package.
\item For the experts, the following make targets are available:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Configure the package:
	\begin{quote}
	\texttt{make config}
	\end{quote}
    \item Create the dependencies among the various source files:
	\begin{quote}
	\texttt{make depend}
	\end{quote}
    \item Clean up all object files and executables:
	\begin{quote}
	\texttt{make clean}
	\end{quote}
    \item Clean up all object files, executables and configuration files:
	\begin{quote}
	\texttt{make distclean}
	\end{quote}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Additional notes}

\begin{itemize}
\item By default it is assumed that the \emph{TIFF} library is available on the
    Linux platform, and that it's not available on the other platforms. If you
    want to change this, you'll have to edit the \emph{TIFF$\ast$} definitions
    in the file \texttt{Rules.config} (created by \texttt{make config}).
\item Currently the \texttt{Makefile} assumes you're using \emph{GNU Make} and
    \emph{GNU \CC\ 2.7.2}.
\item The development was mainly done under \emph{Linux/ia32 2.0.x} and
    \emph{2.2.x}, with some testing under \emph{Solaris/SPARC 2.5.x} and
    \emph{2.6.x}, and \emph{Linux 2.0.x} through \emph{2.3.x} on non-Intel
    platforms (\emph{m68k, PPC, AXP}). Your mileage may vary on other
    systems.
\item The linker might complain about undefined symbols on systems where the
    native linker doesn't support constructors and \name{collect2} is used.
\item If you want support for \emph{TIFF}, then you need the \emph{TIFF}
    library.
\end{itemize}
