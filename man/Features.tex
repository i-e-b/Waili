\section{Features of \libname}

\libname\ is a wavelet transform library:
\begin{itemize}
\item Uses integer wavelet transforms based on the lifting Scheme
\item Provides various wavelet transforms of the Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau
family of biorthogonal wavelets
\item Provides crop and merge operations on wavelet-transformed images
\item Provides noise reduction based on wavelet thresholding using Generalized
Cross Validation
\item Provides scaling of images
\item Provides edge enhancement of images
\item Provides also some simple image operations (addition and subtraction of images)
\item Allows different image representations (RGB, YUV, Lab, \ldots )
\end{itemize}
